## Returning to French India

In 2017, after a 16-year hiatus, I returned to India with my father for a week-long trip to see my now
late-grandmother. As a child, our family made trips to India during the summer holidays, and they usually
lasted four-to-six weeks. The trips were often to reconnect with dear relatives, celebrate Hindu festivals,
or to take in the sights within Tamil Nadu state. But as a teenager, trips to the 'Mother Land' also made
me uncomfortable. It could have been the unpaved roads, the stricken poverty, the hot summers, or the
Indian-style toilets — I'm not entirely sure. I hadn't felt the urge to return, until only recently.

### Background

> "A universal town where men and women of all countries are able to live in peace and progressive harmony, above all creeds, all politics and all nationalities." Mirra Alfassa

My mother is from Pondicherry [^1], a
small coastal town in Southern India, and about three hours south of Chennai [^2]. Pondicherry, a former French colony, was relinquished back to
India in the 1960s, and much of that era's influences remain to this day — a French-like residue. During
the transition period, perhaps as a parting gift, locals were offered the option to take up French citizenship
if they wished — and many did, including some of our relatives. These days, Pondicherry is a sleepy —
by Indian standards — town with French expatriates and local Tamilians living alongside with fondness for
each other. The French side features wide boulevards, a laid-back way of life, European architecture, and
of course, freshly-baked baguettes. The Tamil side, as you might expect, is characterized by the loud
horns of auto-rickshaws and two-wheelers, historic temples, and a bustling market — Pondy Bazaar.
Although many visit Pondicherry to take in its unique French character, it's what lies just north of
Pondicherry, that's the real treasure — Auroville[^3].

*Entrance at Auroville.*

I think it was 2001 when I visited the 20-square-kilometer commune known as Auroville, for the first time.
Auroville is hard to define in simple terms. It is considered an experimental township[^4] endeavoring to
realize human unity, self-reliance, and the setting for one to discover their purpose. It was established in
1968 by two French diasporas, Mirra Alfassa and Roger Anger, along with the spiritual philosopher Sri
Aurobindo . Alfassa affectionately known as 'The Mother' described Auroville as "a universal town where
men and women of all countries are able to live in peace and progressive harmony, above all creeds, all
politics and all nationalities" [^5]. When I visited Auroville at the
turn of the millennium, it was still under construction some thirty-years into its founding. Despite this, I
vaguely recall stepping inside an unfinished, white, dome-like structure that consisted of spiraling ramps
leading into an empty void. Unbeknownst to the younger me, I was standing in the heart of Alfassa's
grand ambition.

### Observing Authenticity

Twenty years on, that unfinished dome-like structure is now a magnificent golden sphere known as The
Matrimandir — the soul of the city. Every aspect of 'The Matriminder' is connected to silence, from the
inner meditation hall (that empty void) to the gardens — aptly named 'Peace' — surrounding the monolith
structure. These days Auroville — also translated to the City of Dawn — is a popular day-trip taken by
tourists and locals from nearby Pondicherry. They come for the sights, to snack at the on-site café, and to
collect handicraft souvenirs to take back home. Yet many around the world still visit Auroville each year,
descending upon its city limits to help it realize it's purpose — human unity — while hoping to understand
their own. Some may stay a week, and some, have arrived and never left [^6].

Unfortunately, my father and I weren't able to step foot inside The Matrimandir on our visit, as it was
closed for maintenance. Despite this, standing on a viewing platform inside Peace's gardens, some 50
meters back, we were still able to marvel at the structure's size and feel its energy. There weren't any
epiphanies or life-changing spiritual moments care of The Matrimandir for me that day. Instead, as I was
walking back to the entrance to leave Auroville — where my father was already waiting — I encountered a
group of young school students. They looked a little younger than me when I first visited Auroville, and it
seemed like they were on a class excursion. They were noisy, barefooted, and full of radiating smiles.
They were captivated by my DSLR camera, and they motioned for me to take their picture. I didn't want to
intrude or stage a moment; instead, I shot a few images candidly without trying to focus or check the
frame through the viewfinder. It was good enough for them, and it seemed to be the highlight of their day.
The interaction was endearing. As I caught up to my father, I remember feeling a sense of gratitude to
have been able to meet the students before leaving Auroville.

### Inspiration for S29 * DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT *

DRAFT * You don't need to travel to Southern India to find an environment to understand your place in the world.
You could visit experimental communities like Copenhagen's self-governing meta-city Christiania , or
Arizona's Arcosanti , which hopes to actualize the concept of 'arcology'. [Conceptualized in 1969 by Paolo
Soleri , who believed the architecture and design of urban environments should be ecologically
low-impact] But, you needn't visit them either to find your sense of purpose or gratitude. If I assumed
stepping inside The Matriminder, was the only opportunity for self-discovery at Auroville, I'd have left
empty-handed that day. It was the chance rendezvous with those kids — likely to be from poor families —
who seemed to be the happiest people in the world, who became my spiritual teachers for that day.
