## Inner Circle, Virtues, and "our" Name

![Image](/assets/images/poster_s12s.jpg)

### Inner Circle

This section, 'Notes' is where I'd like to informally document happenings about the brand. I'm AS, and I'm the founder of Subsystematics<sup>BETA</sup>, a new skincare system/philosophy/brand/universe for human potential. If you're reading this, you're perhaps part of the <b>Inner Circle</b>, where I'll share these posts directly to your inbox as well as offer invitations to product field tests, and perhaps even local events. 

If you haven't joined yet, you can do so from the [Index](/index) page.

### Virtues

Two personal discoveries I made and now traits I gravitate towards are that of autonomy and purpose. While I've had the chance to work at some esteemed companies over the years, I found these two virtues were either present or not. While I never had the fortune of experiencing both concurrently—despite them being far from mutually exclusive— the taste of each shifted my perspective on future work and things we consume.

It's early days, but as I set out to build Subsystematics I'm going to try my best to seek out these virtues. I want to ingrain them into the fabric of this company, from operations to conversations with customers (and non-customers). More specifically, I have embraced two practical guidances to help me actualize this today. That is operating as a "company of one" and second, truly envisioning a brand which is more than just product. By celebrating and doubling-down on these, my inner peace is whole and my commercial goals are honest:

- Guidance 1: A robust one-man entity affords many advantages and ideals
- Guidance 2: A brand is not a product, but rather a universe

Of course as Subsystematics grows the first guidance is less practical, so it will be a matter of capturing the essence and prioritizing it. What is important is that additions to the company are honest and organic for sustaining longevity and dividends into perpetuity. Guidance two is much more abstract, so I expect some deviation, but the premise is to not commercialize too quickly or launch inferior products for the sake of launching. Instead, what are the intangible to create?

These points may sound obvious, but how many companies are motivated by raising financing only to be forced their hand into growing at all costs? Or how many products have entered the market because it's supposedly "direct to you", and that's somehow better aside from price? 

### Sub•system•atics

The word Subsystematics is a somewhat of a misnomer, because it's not quite an actual word (found in a dictionary), but it is the conjoining of two actual words in: subsystem and systematics. As the words hint, Sub•system•atics is about systems and hierarchy, with the system in this context being <i>you</i>, and the hierarchy being—what I am calling for now—programs.

The mission is to eventually create a finite set of programs to support a system, in order to pursue a broader, more holistic goal, in human potential. After all, healthy skin is a function of good diet, regular movement and mental soundness.

Over the coming weeks I will share more about the Subsystematics brand meta-thoughts and I hope you'll enjoy the journey with me. Finally, it's worth noting, Subsystematics is quite the handful to say (and write) so feel free to use the shorthand "S12S" interchangeably.
